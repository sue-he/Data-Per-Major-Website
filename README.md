EduStat: Data per Major
Team Members: Khalid Hussain (khalidh223), Ayman Rahadian (arahadian), and Xueqi He (sue-he)

This project was the final project for CS 257: Software Design at Carleton College. We created a site which allows users to see information about popularity and median salary in five years for any bachelorâ€™s degree in the United States of their choosing. Please refer to the files in Proposal for more information about the project's goal.

We implemented multiple parts of our website for this deliverable, however the only edit that contains a form (at this moment)
is the 'Salary' page of our website; the rest is supplementary. The structures of the website are formulated in the templates folder via HTML, and the design of each page is constructed by CSS. The data was from National Center for Education Statistics, and fetched for display via SQL commands.

The project was built upon a web server hosted by Carleton College, hence it's not operable without the designated user name. I'm happy to answer any question you have. Please feel free to contact me.
